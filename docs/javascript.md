# JavaScript

## Single Threaded

- JS is a single threaded language

## Asynchronous programming

- Is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

## Call Stack

- A stack of tasks that need to be finished
- A call stack is a mechanism interpreter in a web browser
- To keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions, what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

## Control Flow

- Is the order in which instructions are executed within a program.
- Conditionals

## Closure & Scope

- function declared or return within an outer function.
- This inner function is only accessible within the outer function
- A closure has three scope chains:
  Has access to the variable defined within its curly braces, which is its scope.
  Has access to the outer functions' variables.
  Has the ability to access global variables.

## Undefined, Undeclared, Null

`Undefined`: Means a variable has been declared but a value has not yet been assigned to that variable.

`Null`: Is an assignment value that you can assign to any variable that is meant to contain no value.

`Undeclared`: Variables that are not declared or that do not exist in a program or application.

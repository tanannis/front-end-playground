# Responsive Design

## Set the viewport / scale

## Use fluid widths as oppose to fixed

For example: setting `max-width` instead of `width` so it respond better for smaller screens

## Media queries - Different CSS styling for different screen sizes

Check Screen Size

- Open up inspector tool in Chrome, click the devices icon next to the arrow
- Check under Dimensions in the dropdown to see the layout for different devices

## Rem units vs px

- By default, Root element of the browsers's paragraph font size is 16px (medium), 24px (very large) if you didn't set a specific font size
- We can reset the Root size
- Calculate `px` size by `rem x Root`

## Vh & Vw units (Viewport Height & Viewport Widths units)

- Viewport is the whole area inside the browser body
- It's always 100 Vh and 100 Vw (100 slices)

## Mobile first method

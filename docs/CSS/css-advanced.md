## CSS Sprites

- Since each image sends out an HTTP request separately, a web page with a high number of photos takes longer to load.
- CSS sprites are used to minimize the loading time of a web page by combining multiple small pictures into a single image.
- It decreases the number of HTTP requests and, as a result, the time it takes for pages to load.

- To copy a line, hold “shift option” and “down arrow” at the same time
- To navigate from word to word I/o character to character on a line, hold “option” and “left or right arrow” at the same time
- To move line up and down, hold “option” and “up / down arrow” at the same time
- To add 4 lists at the same time, type “li \* 4”
- \*\* No need to type the whole <form action=…”> you can simply type “form” hit enter, the whole form tag will pop up, same as other tags
- Type “input:email” will auto generate the whole input tag for email only, the user can input email
- Select a word, then hold “command-D” will select the next word with the same value
- Hold “shift - tab” will bring all lines backward
- Type “div#about” will give you <div id=“about”> or “h1#about” will give you <h1 id=“about>
- “#box-1.box” is a short hand to show <div id="box-1" class="box">
- “ul.side-menu” is a short hand to have <ul class=“side-menu”>
